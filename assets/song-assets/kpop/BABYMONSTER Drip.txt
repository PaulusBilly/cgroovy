When I dress, I don't think so much
I could be the GOAT, I don't need too much

Baby, so cold, get that ice cream truck

아름다운 별들이 빛나는 밤이야
Mmm, what you say? (What you say?)
끝없는 가치 you know it's all me
Got that
Mmm, what you say? (What you say?)
Are you ready? Set, turn on the lights
Baby, got passion, ambition 난 보란 듯이
Look at that 온몸으로 느끼는 내 몸짓
Baby, got drip (drip), drip (drip), drip (drip), drip
Baby, got drip (drip), drip (drip), drip (drip), drip

MONSTIEZ 꽉 잡아 hold tight
끝까지 밟아 you know we gon' ride
Mmm, na-na-na, I'll be there 고민하지 마

가끔 쓰러진대도
I'ma shine as bright as diamonds
Say my name
