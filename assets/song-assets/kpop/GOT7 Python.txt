Rainbow roses, fancy ice
녹아내려 inside your eyes
현실 같은 꿈의 site
Feelings drifting like the tide
I left my guard down for a minute
I never play with feelings, but I thought you were committed
The way that I'm addicted is specific (specific)
It's your vibe, it's your mind, it's the things I can't describe
I've been runnin' backwards
Running backwards like a marathon
모든 순간 속에 네가 있어 제어할 수 없지
날 길들인 감각만이 자꾸 멋대로, no
I know I'm an (icon), watch me with the lights on
But she got a hold on me like a python
I don't wanna lose her, yeah, she was my future
Shot to the chest, I was falling for the shooter
I don't wanna, I don't wanna have to let her go
I should move on, I know
I know I'm an icon, 너 없인 다 lights off
But she got a hold on me like a python (yeah, yeah)
I gave you my time when I didn't have much
All of my feelings swept under the rug
I'm touring the world, but I'm missing the one
Who held it down, music is how I've been venting now
Broken glass, I'm bleeding out, overseas I'm selling out
Private planes, I got taste, I got seven golden rings
My accountant called me up, said the moneys stacked to space
What a snake with them eyes, I won't even try to lie
I wish I could let you go, I wish I could say goodbye
I've been running backwards
Running backwards like a marathon
모든 순간 속에 네가 있어 제어할 수 없지
