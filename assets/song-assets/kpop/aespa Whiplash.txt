one look, give 'em whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해 uh
왜 이제야 know I did that, uh
Day one, know I been bad, uh
Don't stop 흔들린 채
무리해도 can't touch that (can't touch that)
Under pressure, body sweating, can you focus? (Yeah)
어디서나 거침없어 I'm the coldest
오직 나만이 이 판을 바꿀 changer
Just close your eyes, breathe in and visualize
One look, give 'em whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해 uh
왜 이제야 know I did that (yeah)
Day one, know I been bad
Don't stop 흔들린 채 (yeah)
무리해도 can't touch that (can't touch that)
Whip-whiplash, whip-whiplash
Whip-whiplash, whip-whiplash
Whip-whiplash, whip-whiplash

알아, 적당함이 뭔지 keep it classy
따라 하지 넌 또 하나부터 열까지 (yeah)
아닌척하지 (yeah)
Under pressure, body sweating, can you focus? (Hoo)
I deliver, I can promise, I'm the coldest (cold)
외면해도 소용없지 don't you blow it?
Just close your eyes, breathe in and visualize
시작되는 순간 끝나버린 판단
기횐 오직 one time, unforgettable
찾아낸 the right light 사라지지 않아
눈에 새긴 one time, unforgettable
One look, give 'em whiplash (sheesh)
Beat drop with a big flash
집중해 좀 더 think fast
이유 넌 이해 못 해 uh

Day one, know I been bad, uh
Don't stop 흔들린 채 (yeah)
무리해도 can't touch that (can't touch that)
I'm the highlight 비춰 red light
Yeah, tonight it's all about me (all about me)
You know it's my site 거친 next sigh
만들어갈 history
One look, give 'em whiplash (whip-whip, sheesh)
Beat drop with a big flash (yeah)
따라와 어서 move fast (move, move, move)
이유 넌 이해 못 해 uh (yeah)
왜 이제야 know I did that, uh (did that, yeah)
Day one, know I been bad, uh (been bad)
Don't stop 흔들린 채 (yeah)
다가와도 can't touch that (can't touch that)
