How was I supposed to know
This is how it gonna go?
Thought that if I put you first enough
We'll last for sure, last for sure (for sure)
Remember our first kiss, was in a rental car
Now I kinda wish it was a hit-and-run
Crazy, I let you get this far
But I was just young and dumb
Six years gone down the drain
I guess I'm half to blame
I didn't know, I didn't know I'd be wasting my time
Spending my 20's on you (oh)
I poured my heart in it
Don't get me started
Spend my time wondering why
I spend my 20's on you
Thought I was learning myself
I was just learning you
Is anything black and white?
When you're bad and 22
Hold onto you like a shirt to a sweater
Hung onto you 'cause I didn't know better
I just feel like time was runnin' out
I can tell the ship was goin' down
I was so young and dumb
Six years gone down the drain
I guess I'm half to blame
I didn't know, I didn't know I'd be wasting my time
Spending my 20's on you (oh)
I poured my heart in it
Don't get me started
Spend my time wondering why
I spend my 20's on you
Oh, I poured my heart in it
Don't get me started
Spend my time wondering why
I spend my 20's on you
