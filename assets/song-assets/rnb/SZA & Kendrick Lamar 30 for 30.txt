I used to think about immature things
You know, like
Do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?
Some of y'all gon' get washed (washed)
Some of y'all just gon' pop shit
Some of y'all just gon' talk (talk)
But none of y'all ain't really got shit
Some of y'all just look lost
I get this type of feeling you ain't accustomed to
I swear I'd be at peace if it weren't for you (yeah, yeah)
Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (huh)
And that's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
Ain't huggin' or smilin' for none of these bitches
That's the way I like it
I'm wipin' 'em down in front of they nigga
That's the way I like it
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm-

Should I fold that bitch, no yoga mat?

Should've ran down on you, no questions asked

When the sun go down, everything make me feel lonely, yeah
Had a lil' side thing, but right now, he's just the homie
Tryna feel good inside, he never wanna hold me
Pipe me up, you get me hyped, you my favorite coach, come press the line
Fucking stress off, that's my only vice
I take it off when he tell me if I'm feelin' fine
I run it up, risk it all like I'm rolling dice
Takin' it all, it's my second life
That's me (that's me)
Passed out in a nigga backseat (backseat)
Crashed out on a black-sand beach (uh)
Already know my body
Already know that's me
Bitch shit, then you might get minked
Mink, mink, mink
Only want the love if it's solid

Everything been otay (otay)
They salute me so damn much, every time I show up, nigga about-face
Everything no cut, I fuck y'all up, I'm really gon' trip 'bout bae (mm-mm)
Blow the '87 guts, why they waitin' on us? Tell 'em I was on PCH
You fuckin' with niggas that's thinkin' they cuter than you, oh
Say you on your cycle, but he on his period too, oh
The tables been turnin' so much, I was thinkin' it's foosball
The tenderness of 'em, mistakin' 'em for some wagyu, oh
Walk, talk, like Kenny, like boss
Like Solana, I promise, more buzz, it's a wasp
It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost
No favors, I'll wager whatever you worth, I ball
Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass
Psychic as fuck, can read your bitch ass
Zodiac sign, it must be a Gemini moon 'cause, shit, we about to go half
Mistakenly, nobody been in they bag, but how many bodies done been in her bed?
