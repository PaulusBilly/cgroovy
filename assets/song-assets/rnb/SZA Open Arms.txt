When you do your best, you ca-, I done told you
When you do your best, hell, that's all you can do
You and me and anybody else
So they always start talkin'
Ooh
Runnin' away from where I'm from
Never can stay with no one
Loving you almost feels like something
When no one's around me, you lost and found me
I was surrounded
With open, open, open
Open arms (ooh)
Open arms, you keep me open
I'm so devoted
You keep me open (ooh)
Open arms
I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
Spent your life bein' hopeless
Chokin' on insecurity
I know all this is bad
But please, put a leash on me anyway
Who needs self-esteem anyway?
I hate myself to make you stay
Push me away, I'll be right here
With open, open, open
Open arms (ooh)
Open arms, you keep me open
I'm so devoted
You keep me open
Open arms
I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided (ay)
I'm forever ridin' (whoa), you're forever guidin' (ay)
Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (brr)
Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence (ooh)
Drew my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, "Where you takin' me?"
Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
For you, I try, face card valid, ID
C'est la vie, go to Paris, it ain't five-star, it ain't me
Over-solid, keep it concrete, I'ma bet it on your whole fee
Just don't switch sides, I could fire piece your wrist, AP
Through the ups and downs and all the heat
Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief, anything, just don't you ever leave
I guess I gotta go (ooh)
I guess it's time to go
I gotta let you go
(I'm so devoted)
You keep me open
Gotta let you go, gotta let you go
I gotta let you go, I must
You're the only one that's holdin' me down (ooh)
You're the only one holdin' me down (only one)
'Cause I'm the only one that's holdin' me down
