I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold
I told myself I would never get old
Then you pulled me in close
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Falling angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive again
Where do I start when I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars when I open my arms
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
Falling in love again
Trapped inside a limbo, watching through a window
Of my soul
Suffering, I've been low, then I see your halo
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Falling angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive for another day
Where do I start when I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars (cover my scars) when I open my arms (open my arms)
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
Falling in love again
